# InfinitLab

**We help growing teams simplify their tech and replace brittle tools with systems they actually own.**

Fractional technical leadership and focused tool migrations that reduce chaos, unlock velocity, and build systems you can depend on.

## What We Do

### Fractional Technical Leadership

Senior technical guidance for teams that need clarity, experience, and direction — without hiring a full-time CTO.

- Reduce decision paralysis and technical debt
- Shape technical direction with senior judgment
- Introduce AI where it helps — restraint where it doesn't
- Mentor teams to move faster with confidence

### Targeted Tool Replacement & Migration

We replace one high-pain internal or external tool with a simple, owned solution — designed to fit your team and workflow.

- Replace fragile tools without disruption
- Reduce operational risk with clear scope
- Deliver clean, documented systems your team owns
- Use AI-assisted development where it adds real value

## Good Fit

This works best for:

- Teams of 10–200 people
- Bootstrapped or lightly funded companies
- Ops-heavy teams with internal tools
- Founders who value ownership and simplicity

## Notable Work

- **Envoy** — Optimized architecture handles 60% more traffic with 10x faster load times
- **RiskScout** — Stabilized architecture enabling confident scaling and faster feature delivery
- **Terra Relocations** — Built an owned system with instant pricing — bookings tripled
